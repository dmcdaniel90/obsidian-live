## Effort / Time Exchange

Learning happens in the brain. When you avoid the hard, difficult thinking associated with thinking, you are avoiding the learning itself. Using shortcuts to lessen the time thinking (i.e the effort), it lessens the amount that you actually learn. It is more effective to increase the amount of effort spent learning. This will increase the retention and understanding. This is called the "Generation Effect".

Think actively as you read. Think about the bigger picture and how ideas relate to each other. This helps to activate the Generation Effect. Taking notes passively takes less effort, and does not activate this effect.

## Omni-learner Principle

The common knowledge is that people have a set way of learning. However, this is a myth. VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinetic). Most all people are good at visual and reading/writing learning as we are exposed to this early on as children, along with auditory. In the professional world, you cannot control how you need to learn things. You should learn to learn things in all four of the different styles. The question you should ask yourself is, "How can I organise this?". To organise something, you must understand:
- Each component
- How they fit together
- Make sense of it
- And rearrange in a way that still makes sense

For example. when reading a paragraph of text, when you come across something that you do not understand, pause and work to fully understand the concept before moving on the next. This may require stepping outside of the current context and doing additional research. But the knowledge you gain from this will provide yourself context for the upcoming sections. Do not accept, but challenge and test what you learn in order to understand it for yourself. The learning has not happened until you organise it yourself.

In auditory learning, it is harder to take notes, but you should simply offload what you hear into notes and then clarify later.

## Iteration Effect

The usual process is to study for a long time, then test intensively towards the end. Effective learning is a constant process of thinking of a hypotheses and then testing if that hypotheses is right or wrong. With each piece of information, always test how you think it all fits together. You want to know this now before you build upon a potentially wrong idea. With any hypotheses, you need to have feedback early on, thus creating the iteration cycle. Test to the max. Find the mistakes and the gaps.
