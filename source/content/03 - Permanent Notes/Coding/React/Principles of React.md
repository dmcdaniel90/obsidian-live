## Summary

React is a Javascript library that: 
- Uses a uni-directional data flow via props being passed down from parent components to child components
- Is declarative, meaning that React handles the mechanics of implementing the declared (via code) UI state.
- Uses a Virtual DOM to keep in sync with the real DOM
- Is built using components and lends itself to [[Atomic Design]]
- Relies on automatic state management over manual DOM manipulation
