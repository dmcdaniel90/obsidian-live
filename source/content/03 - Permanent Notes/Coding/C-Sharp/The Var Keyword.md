## Summary

The `var` keyword is used to save developers on excessive typing when a variable's type can be easily inferred by the compiler. It cannot be uninitialised, and also cannot be declared outside of the global scope.

```C#
string name = "Juan";
// you could replace string with var...but here's a message usage of it
Person person = new Person();
// becomes
var person = new Person();
// after compilation becomes again...
Person person = new Person();
```
