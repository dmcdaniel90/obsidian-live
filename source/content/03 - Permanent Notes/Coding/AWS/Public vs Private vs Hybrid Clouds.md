## Summary

There are four types of cloud: Public, Private, Hybrid, and Multicloud. These are separate from [[The 4 types of cloud service models]].

**Public clouds** are typically where the end-user does not own the IT infrastructure (i.e. AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud). All clouds that serve multiple tenants are public clouds. They are best suited for fluctuating workloads. They are the least secure because of multiple touchpoints and [[Shared Responsibility Model|split security responsibilities]].

**Private clouds** serve a single user or group, usually behind a firewall. All clouds become private when they serve a single user with completely isolated access. They are best suited for static workloads and are only as secure as the firewall protecting them.

**Hybrid clouds** are a collection of public and private clouds, VPNs, and/or APIs managed with one management and orchestration platform. They offer the best security of private and public clouds, allowing data to be split among environments by security and compliance rules.

**Multiclouds** are an approach using unconnected clouds from different vendors, often for security purposes.
