## Summary

The 3 primary types of cloud computing models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

IaaS vendors provide the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically include features for networking, data storage, and servers.

PaaS vendors remove much of the need to manage underlying infrastructure, allowing business owners to focus on developing, testing, deploying, and managing software.

SaaS vendors provide software applications that are run and managed by the vendor. Typically used by an end-user.

A 4th type, called Serverless computing, or simply [serverless](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/serverless), is a cloud computing model that offloads all the back-end infrastructure management tasks to the cloud provider. This capability frees developers to focus all their time and effort on the code and business logic specific to their applications.
