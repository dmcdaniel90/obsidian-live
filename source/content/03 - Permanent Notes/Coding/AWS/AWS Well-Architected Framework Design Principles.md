## Summary

_Design for failure_ means to assume that everything can and will fail, so you try to plan ahead for scenarios where failure could occur.

_Decoupling components_ means to create components in a way that makes them independent from each other in the case that one should fail, the other is unaffected.

_Implement elasticity_ means to respond dynamically to system workload, allocating more or less resources depending on demand.

_Think parallel_ means to break up work into smaller, concurrently running processes instead of one long, ongoing process.
