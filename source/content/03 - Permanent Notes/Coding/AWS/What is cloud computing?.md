## Summary

Cloud computing is the on-demand access to computer resources, such as servers, networking, software, and security, often with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Cloud services allow users to access resources without necessarily having the hardware, such as storage space, to support accessing them. Examples of cloud storage are Dropbox and Amazon S3.
