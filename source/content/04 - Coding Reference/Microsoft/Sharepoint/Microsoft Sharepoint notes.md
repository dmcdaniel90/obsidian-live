>[!question] How does Microsoft Viva relate to Sharepoint and how can we utilise it?

>[!important] Setting the home site needs to be done in the Viva Connections admin center, not the Sharepoint Admin Center. Make sure you know how to access both of these.

>[!todo] Set the read-write permissions and sharing policy
>It needs to be setup so that no can edit the site except myself, abi and roanne. However, I need to see what actions 'edit' level permissions allow.
>
>The sharing policies may require a document drafted up and a meeting.

>[!question] What do I need to implement on the main home page?
> When users land on the main page, it should be a personalised page that provides daily-scoped information and frequent tasks.
> 
> Systems a user may need quick information on could include Asana, GitHub, Teams, and HubSpot.
> 
> From Asana, it would be beneficial to include a view of Today's tasks.
> For HubSpot, we can show assigned notifications
> For GitHub, listing PR updates
> For Teams, showing personal Shifts data, upcoming meetings, etc.
> 
> Common parts include
> News Hero

>[!todo] Sharepoint News Bot
>Take the project updates from Asana and create News items in Sharepoint
