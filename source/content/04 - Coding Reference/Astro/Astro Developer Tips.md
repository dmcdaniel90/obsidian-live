> [!Caution] HTML vs JSX style comments
> HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead.

>[!tip] Debugging with console.log
>You can use console.logs in the frontmatter of your pages to debug inside of your editor's terminal. Logs are not output to the browser (but will appear in the backend logging)
