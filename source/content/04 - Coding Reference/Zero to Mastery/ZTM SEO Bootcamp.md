## SEO Introduction

### Google Search

>[!question] What is Google Search?
>Accounting for 90 - 92% of all searches worldwide, Google Search Engine is the most dominant engine in the world. It helps billions of people asking trillions of questions in hundreds of languages and receive answers in less than one second. It aims to be a worldwide and universally-accessible search engine.

>[!question] How does it work?
>It takes in input from a user, makes a copy of the web, and compares the input to the words on each page of the web. It attempts to put the most useful matches at the top of the results through a top-secret algorithm that looks for factors such as user location, how recent the website was updated, how many other pages link to that page, the number and placement of keywords, and more.

>[!question] How is Google so fast?
>Google software runs on servers, or large numbers of computers that are stored in large centres placed strategically around the world. The servers work together by making a copy of the web, splitting it up, and indexing/searching their dedicated piece. Every data centre has their own copy of the web, so they serve a particular region of the world and enable users to access websites across the world much faster.

## Online Keyword Research Tools

>[!question] What is keyword research?
>A keyword is word a user types into a search engine when looking for a website. The more your site matches a particular keyword, the higher it appears in search rankings, which results in higher traffic and, consequently, higher revenue and higher rankings.

>[!info] Keywords can be classified into Informational or Commercial intent
>Example: *What is a dog lead* - dog lead is an informational keyword here
>Example: *dog lead* - by itself, is likely a commercial keyword and will search for sellers of dog leads

>[!info] Keywords can also be a classified into short tail and long tail keywords
>Short tail keywords consist of 1-2 words only. Short tail is more general, where long tail keywords are more specific and are better indicators of search intent. Long tail keywords have smaller search volumes, but higher conversion. Focus on long tail first to avoid competing against more established websites.
